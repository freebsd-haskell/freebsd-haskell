This library provides bindings for the Dot language used by the Graphviz
suite of programs for visualising graphs, as well as functions to call
those programs.  Main features of the graphviz library include:

  * Almost complete coverage of all Graphviz attributes and syntax.
  * Support for specifying clusters.
  * The ability to use a custom node type.
  * Functions for running a Graphviz layout tool with all specified
    output types.
  * The ability to not only generate but also parse Dot code with two
    options: strict and liberal (in terms of ordering of statements).
  * Functions to convert FGL graphs and other graph-like data structures
    to Dot code - including support to group them into clusters - with a
    high degree of customisation by specifying which attributes to use
    and limited support for the inverse operation.
  * Round-trip support for passing an FGL graph through Graphviz to
    augment node and edge labels with positional information, etc.
