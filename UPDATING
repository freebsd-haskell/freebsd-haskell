  On FreeBSD, git-annex incorrectly calculated SHA256 hashes for files
  added to the annex repository due to the BSD-style output of
  /sbin/sha256.  The result of this is silent data corruption.

  This problem has been fixed, but every file stored in an annex
  repository will fail a `git annex fsck` after the upgrade.  Thus,
  before updating, it is wise to issue the command below and restore the
  files.

  $ git annex uninit

  Corruptions can then be found by finding all files with the same hash.
  Note that only files that were mishashed to the same location are a
  problem.
