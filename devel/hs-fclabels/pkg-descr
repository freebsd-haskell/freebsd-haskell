This package provides first-class labels that can act as bidirectional record
fields.  The labels can be derived automatically using Template Haskell which
means you do not have to write any boilerplate yourself.  The labels are
implemented as lenses and are fully composable.  Labels can be used to get, set
and modify parts of a data type in a consistent way.
