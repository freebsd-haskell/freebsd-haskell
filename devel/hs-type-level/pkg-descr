This library permits performing computations on the type-level.
Type-level functions are implemented using functional dependencies of
multi-parameter type classes.  To date, Booleans and Numerals (Naturals
and Positives) are supported.  With regard to Numerals, there is support
for common arithmetic operations (addition, substraction,
multiplication, division, exponientation, logarithm, maximum,
comparison, GCD) over natural numbers (using a decimal representation to
make compile-time errors friendlier).  Although making use of type-level
computations might seem devious and obfuscated at first sight, it is
indeed useful in practice to implement lightweight dependent types such
us number-parameterized types (e.g.  an array type parameterized by the
array's size or a modular group type Zn parameterized by the modulus).
