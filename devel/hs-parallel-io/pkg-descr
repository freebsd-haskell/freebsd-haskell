This package provides combinators for sequencing IO actions onto a thread
pool. The thread pool is guaranteed to contain no more unblocked threads
than a user-specified upper limit, thus minimizing contention. Furthermore,
the parallel combinators can be used reentrantly - your parallel actions
can spawn more parallel actions - without violating this property of the
thread pool.
