This package defines the type class MonadControlIO, a subset of MonadIO
into which generic control operations such as catch can be lifted from
IO. Instances are based on monad transformers in MonadTransControl,
which includes all standard monad transformers in the transformers
library except ContT. For convenience, it provides a wrapped version of
Control.Exception with types generalized from IO to all monads in
MonadControlIO.
