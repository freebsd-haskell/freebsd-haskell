Mozilla have developed a robust and efficient character set detection
algorithm for use in their web browsers.  The algorithm is able to
detect all of the most frequently encountered character encodings
totally automatically.  This library wraps up their library and exposes
a very simple Haskell interface to it.  The library is portable, and is
confirmed to work on both Unix and Windows.
