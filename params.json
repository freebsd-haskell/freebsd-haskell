{"name":"Ports","tagline":"Developer FreeBSD Haskell \"overlay\" for the mighty FreeBSD Ports Collection.  Use with caution, slippery when wet, etc.","body":"Welcome!\r\n========\r\n\r\nThis repository is to provide support for working with the Glorious\r\nGlasgow Haskell Compilation System and Haskell Cabal on FreeBSD, it\r\nhosts the work of volunteers interested in maintaining such ports.  It\r\nconsidered *a highly experimental collection* and it may contain ports\r\nthat are not present in the Ports Collection currently.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to Use\r\n----------\r\n\r\nIn order to use the ports in this repository, you will have to install\r\n[portshaker(8)](http://www.freshports.org/ports-mgmt/portshaker/) and\r\nits configuration files, be sure you are selecting the `HASKELL` option:\r\n\r\n    # cd /usr/ports/ports-mgmt/portshaker-config\r\n    # make install clean\r\n\r\nStart `portshaker(8)`, and answer the questions (if there is any).  They\r\nusually refer to colluding ports where the recommended answer is\r\n`install` or simply `i`.\r\n\r\n    # portshaker -v\r\n\r\nYou can use the ports as usual after the process has finished.\r\n\r\n\r\nBinary Packages\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nIt is also possible to use binary packages built from these ports via\r\n[pkg(8)](http://www.freshports.org/ports-mgmt/pkg).  Note that these\r\npackages *are not supported officially* and *may not be consistent* with\r\nthe packages in the official FreeBSD `pkg(8)` repository, so use them at\r\nyour own risk!  They are also *updated on a best-effort basis*, although\r\nyou can find packages for all supported architectures and versions\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nFirst, you will have to make sure that `pkg(8)` is installed on your\r\nsystem and your ports are all converted to this new format.  Consult the\r\n[FreeBSD Handbook](http://www.freebsd.org/handbook/pkgng-intro.html) on\r\nthe details.\r\n\r\nConfigure the corresponding package repository.  That is, create a\r\n`Haskell.conf` file under `$LOCALBASE/etc/pkg/repos`, with the following\r\ncontents:\r\n\r\n    Haskell: {\r\n      url: \"http://terraform.cs.hm.edu/packages/${ABI}/latest\",\r\n      enabled: yes\r\n    }\r\n\r\nFinally, fetch the latest version of the repository catalogue:\r\n\r\n    # pkg update\r\n\r\nNow you are ready to install or upgrade binary packages from this\r\nrepository via the standard `pkg(8)` commands.  For example, installing\r\nor updating Haskell Platform requires this single command only:\r\n\r\n    # pkg install hs-haskell-platform\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to Report Bugs\r\n------------------\r\n\r\nLet us know if you have problems with installing and using the ports in\r\nthe repository, because receiving feedback is always useful, and\r\ndefinitely a way to get your issues fixed :-)\r\n\r\nThere are many different ways to report bugs.\r\n\r\n- Create an issue [right\r\n  here](https://github.com/freebsd-haskell/freebsd-haskell/issues).\r\n\r\n- Mail us at [haskell(at)freebsd.org](mailto:haskell_at_freebsd.org) or\r\n  [freebsd-haskell(at)haskell.org](mailto:freebsd-haskell_at_haskell.org).\r\n\r\n- Poke us interactively on `#haskell-FreeBSD` at\r\n  [freenode](http://www.freenode.net/).\r\n\r\n**Note:** Please, do not use FreeBSD GNATS to report issues with these\r\nports because it is mainly for ports *in the Ports Collection*.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to Contribute\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\nDo not forget to contribute your fixes if you already have a patch for a\r\nknown problem!  You can use the same interface as for reporting bugs.\r\nChange requests and new ports are also welcome.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
